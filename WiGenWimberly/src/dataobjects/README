The dataobjecs package contains all the data objects (listed below). These objects are created during file reads
and are read during file writes. 

An overall assumption that was made was that School will contain grades, which will contain classrooms,
and classrooms will contain teachers and students. (It may have been better to not assume this and have
Person object maintain more information).

Classroom.java
	Maintains two ArrayLists<Person> of Students and Teachers.
Grade.java
	Maintains a HashMap<Long, Classroom> for Classrooms
Person.java
	Maintains FirstName, LastName and PrimaryID
PrimaryId.java
	Maintains an id as a long
School.java
	Maintains a Grade array for 13 grades and an additional NULL grade. 
SchoolManager.java
	Maintains an ArrayList of Schools
	
	
I used ArrayLists when it did not seem that elements would be searched for and only iterated.
I used a HashMap when it appeared that specific elements would need to be searched.
