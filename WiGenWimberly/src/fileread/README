This package contains classes for reading both XML and CSV files as well as an interface that 
classes that wish to read should implement. The interface (FileReadStrategy.java) facilitates along with
ReadContext.java the Strategy Pattern. In using this pattern it is very simple to switch between different
types of file readers during run time. Now anytype of file reader can be interacted with in the same matter 
by creating a context for that file reader and calling the read method. 

The same is true for the filewrite package.
